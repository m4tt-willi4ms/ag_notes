# M@'s Algebraic Geometry Notes

Hi all, this site contains some notes that I've written up while going through
Leonard Dickson's 1926 text titled "Modern Algebraic Theories"
{cite}`dickson_book`.

One of the motivations in writing these notes was to show how inline
calculations can be included with the main text, so that the claims being made
can be readily verified. So, throughout these notes, the reader will find code
snippets which make use of the Python-based computer algebra library `SymPy` to
demonstrate/check the claims being made. If the reader wishes to run these
notebooks themselves, the source code for this website (made using <a

href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html">JupyterBook</a>) can be
found <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/m4tt-willi4ms/ag_notes">here</a>.

The motivation to write these notes came originally from reading the AMS note by
Bruce Bartlett {cite}`bartlett_2024`, which discusses the connection between
quintics, icosahedral symmetry, and elliptic curves.
